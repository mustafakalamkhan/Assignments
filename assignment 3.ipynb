    "    Ques 1 - Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "Ans 1 - Functions are advantageous to have in your programs for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability: Functions make a program more readable, especially large programs. Breaking the code into smaller functions keeps the program structured, understandable, and reusable.\n",
    "Reusability: Functions can be reused countless times after they are defined.\n",
    "Reduced Program Size: Functions can help reduce the size of a program by being called and used at different places in the program.\n",
    "Code Modularity: Functions help in code modularity, which means that the entire code is divided into separate blocks, each self-contained and performing a different task. This makes each block implementation and debugging much more accessible.\n",
    "Efficiency in Top-Down Programming: In top-down structured programming, dividing a program into functions is more efficient and easy to understand.\n",
    "Ease of Use: If you just use the function in your program, you donâ€™t have to worry about how it works inside. For example, the printf() function."

    "    Ques 2 - When does the code in a function run: when its specified or when its called?\n",
    "Ans 2 - Functions are like recipes in a cookbook. The recipe contains instructions on how to cook a particular dish, but the cooking process doesn't start until you decide to follow the recipe and start cooking. Similarly, the code inside a function is not executed until the function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is beneficial because it allows you to define a function once and then use it multiple times throughout your code without having to rewrite the same code over and over again. It also means that the code inside a function doesn't take up any computational resources until it's actually needed."

    "Ans 13- To save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error\n",
    "1-Use error handling techniques: You can use try-except blocks to catch and handle errors gracefully. This allows your program to continue running even if an error occurs, rather than crashing.\n",
    "2-Validate user input: Make sure that user input is in the correct format and meets any necessary conditions before using it in your program. This can help prevent errors caused by invalid input.\n",
    "3-Use type checking: Make sure that variables are of the correct type before using them in operations that require a specific type. This can help prevent errors caused by incorrect variable types.\n",
    "4-Use assertions: Assertions can be used to check that certain conditions are met before proceeding with a section of code. If an assertion fails, it can help you identify where the problem is occurring.\n",
    "5-Test your code thoroughly: Make sure to test your code thoroughly before deploying it. This can help you catch and fix errors before they cause problems in production.\n",
    "6-Use logging: Logging can help you keep track of what your program is doing and can help you diagnose errors if they occur.\n",
    "7-Use version control: Version control can help you keep track of changes to your code and can make it easier to roll back changes if something goes wrong.\n",
    "8-Follow best practices: Make sure to follow best practices for coding, such as using descriptive variable names, commenting your code, and keeping your code organized and modular. This can help make your code more robust and less prone to errors.\n",
    "9-By using these techniques, you can help prevent your program from crashing if it encounters an error, and make it more robust and reliable.\n",
